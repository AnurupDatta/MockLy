Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone.

My name is Anurup Datta, and I stand before you today not just as a student, but as the founder of MockLy — an initiative born out of a very real problem that most of us have faced:

The lack of accessible, customizable, and practical mock test platforms.

Let me take you back for a second.

As students, we’ve all spent hours reading textbooks, flipping through MCQs at the back of books or inside PDFs, and thinking —

“Am I really ready for the exam?”

We memorize, we revise, but when it comes to applying that knowledge under pressure — in a proper mock test — we often struggle.
And if we do want that mock test experience, we usually have to pay institutes, or rely on outdated, rigid platforms that don’t align with the material we’re actually studying.

I personally faced this during my NPTEL exam.

It was MCQ-based, and most of the questions were derived directly from our assignments. But when I saw those same questions — shuffled and mixed — under real exam pressure, I froze.
Even after reading and revising everything, I wasn’t confident.
Why?
Because I had only read the questions — not practiced them like a test.

That lack of readiness, that uncertainty — that’s where MockLy comes in.

🚀 Introducing MockLy
MockLy is a smart quiz and MCQ practice platform that empowers you to turn your own study material into a complete mock test experience.

Here’s what it can do:

🔹 Upload any PDF that contains MCQs — and it instantly becomes an interactive quiz
🔹 Practice now or save it for later
🔹 Use features like shuffling questions, re-attempting, and a detailed scoreboard to track your progress
🔹 If your material doesn’t have MCQs, you can upload plain text and MockLy will generate MCQs using AI
🔹 You can also save these questions as notes or download them as PDFs

In short, MockLy helps you test yourself using your own resources, exactly how and when you want to — without relying on external coaching or expensive test packages.

💡 Why I Built It
MockLy isn’t just a coding project — it’s a solution to a real academic pain point that I and so many others have experienced.

I asked myself:

“Why should mock testing be a luxury?”
“Why can’t we create an affordable, flexible, student-friendly testing tool?”

MockLy is that answer.

It fills the gap between passive reading and active exam prep. It builds confidence, improves recall, and lets you prepare smarter — on your terms.

🌱 The Vision
My vision for MockLy is to bring this powerful tool to every student — whether they’re preparing for class tests, NPTEL, competitive exams, or just want to study smarter.

It’s time we took back control of our learning journey.

So today, with great excitement and belief in this mission, I officially launch — MockLy.

Let’s move beyond just studying.
Let’s practice, prepare, and perform — with clarity and confidence.
